Git Create Worktree
Overview

Create a new working tree (a separate directory) linked to the current repository, allowing you to work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching back and forth.
Steps

    Identify the target branch

        Decide if you are checking out an existing branch or creating a new one.

        List existing branches: git branch

    Choose a destination path

        The path must be outside your current working directory (usually one level up).

        Example: ../project-feature-x

    Create the worktree

        For an existing branch: * git worktree add <path> <branch-name>

        For a new branch:

            git worktree add -b <new-branch-name> <path> <base-branch>

    Navigate and Install

        cd <path>

        Run your environment setup (e.g., npm install or pip install) since the node_modules or virtual envs are not shared across worktrees.

Template

    Existing branch:

        git worktree add ../<folder-name> <existing-branch>

    New branch:

        git worktree add -b <new-branch-name> ../<folder-name> <base-branch>

Rules

    No duplicates: You cannot check out the same branch in two different worktrees at the same time.

    Pathing: Always use a path outside the current Git root to avoid "nesting" repositories accidentally.

    Cleanup: When finished, remember to remove the worktree properly:

        git worktree remove <path>

        Alternatively, delete the folder and run git worktree prune.

    State: Ensure the repository is in a stable state before adding a worktree to avoid locking the index during heavy operations.
